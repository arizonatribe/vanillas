# Benchmark tests

| Benchmark Date | Node version | Operating  System |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| 04/05/22       | v16.0.0      | Linux Fedora (35) |

This project regularly benchmarks itself against similar projects like [lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash), [ramda](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ramda) and [fxjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fxjs). In addition to benchmarking against those three main util libraries, there are a few benchmarks against specialized libraries (as is the case for the [fuzzy filter](#fuzzy) and the many [object validator](#validate) libraries out there).

Not every library offers the same functionality, but if you notice any untested util function, please submit an __issue__ so the benchmark test can be added.

__Note__: The FxJs util function is missing a few cases where a value _should_ be interpreted as an Object:

* Traditional Object hashmaps - Created by `Object.create(null)`
* New'd up classes which have their own custom constructor functions other than the native JavaScript `Object` constructor

This is why Vanillas is checking whether the prototype and constructor are missing (as wish hashmaps) and that the constructor name isn't among a select list of obvious non-Objects.
