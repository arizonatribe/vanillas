# Benchmark tests

This project regularly benchmarks itself against similar projects like [lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash), [ramda](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ramda) and [fxjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fxjs). In addition to benchmarking against those three main util libraries, there are a few benchmarks against specialized libraries (as is the case for the [fuzzy filter](#fuzzy) and the many [object validator](#validate) libraries out there).

Not every library offers the same functionality, but if you notice any untested util function, please submit an __issue__ so the benchmark test can be added.
